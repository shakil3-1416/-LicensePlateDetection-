# -LicensePlateDetection-
"An Open-Source Repository for License Plate Detection using Deep Learning, trained on Indian License Plates Dataset."
The purpose of this project was to explore and work with the "Indian License Plates" dataset, a valuable resource for training a license plate detection model. The project involved data collection, data preprocessing, and the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to detect license plates in images. It aimed to provide a more understandable and organized version of a Kaggle notebook, making it easier for others to work with the dataset. While the model's performance showed potential, with an 80% validation accuracy, it was acknowledged that the dataset was relatively small, and the simple CNN model was meant as a proof of concept. The project serves as a foundation for more complex license plate detection applications and illustrates the capabilities of CNNs in this context.
